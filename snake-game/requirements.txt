To create the snake game we need the following steps:

    first we need to have the body of the snake
        to determine the body of the snake we need to figure out the size of the screen for the game 
    
    second we need to be able to move the snake
        in order to do that we need to read the turtle library documents on their animatios section

    third after we figure out the design of the snake and screen size, we can now think of how to control the snake
        now we need to create a keypress method so that we can control the snake

    fourth detecting the collision with food

    fifth putting a scoreboard just for fun 

    sixth we need to have a settings for the snake where if it hit the wall its game over

    seventh choosing which side can detect the collision
